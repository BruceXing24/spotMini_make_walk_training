### Project Overview

The SpotMini Quadruped Robot project is a culmination of cutting-edge technologies aimed at creating a highly capable and adaptable quadruped robot. The project can be broken down into the following main components:

#### **Mechanical Design and Fabrication**

 I've meticulously designed and 3D printed each part of the quadruped robot, ensuring precision and robustness. This step involved careful consideration of the robot's physical structure to support its weight, balance, and range of motion.

#### Kinematic Pose Control

I've implemented sophisticated kinematic algorithms that enable precise control over the robot's poses. This includes the ability to control joint angles, mimic animal-like movements, and achieve stable standing positions.

#### Self-Balancing Mechanism

 One of the highlights of the project is the self-balancing capability of the robot using pid control. Through a combination of sensors, actuators, and control algorithms, the robot can maintain its balance even on uneven surfaces, showcasing its agility and adaptability.

#### **Walking and Locomotion:**

The culmination of the project's efforts is the achievement of walking and dynamic locomotion. By implementing advanced gait generation techniques and motion planning algorithms, the robot can perform a variety of walking patterns with different speeds and styles.

#### Reinforcement Learning (RL) Training

 To elevate the robot's autonomy and adaptability, I've employed Reinforcement Learning techniques. By setting up a reward system and using RL algorithms, the robot learns to optimize its actions, further enhancing its ability to navigate its environment and perform complex tasks.
